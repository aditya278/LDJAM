A Repo for LDJAM

Our first Ludum Dare submission.

It’s a game about our friend Mr. Poopypants. He visits an Amusement Park. But to his surprise there are a lot of creepy peoples who transforms themselves into bacteria type monsters when they sense “Fat” around themselves. But our friend can’t stop eating. :P  Also Keep it in mind that the more he eats, the slower he'll move.

Now help him to get out of this Park by following the rule: You have to ride all the rides to get out.

Happy Helping!
